Technologies used
- iOS
- XCode
- Swift Language
- Swift Combine. This is my first attempt at using Combine. Familiar with RxSwift.
- UIKit
- iOS Network API's to fetch data school directory and details

Additional possibilities
- Instead of displaying schools as a list, the schools can be put on a map since the directory has school location data(latitude and longitude)
